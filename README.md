# Governance+

For Victoria 3

## Overview

**Governance+** (Gov+) is a mod for [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) that aims to lightly rework the laws for Governance Principles and Distribution of Power to allow for a little more flexibility in shaping a government, namely, the ability to have a government functioning as a republic whilst nominally working within the framework of a monarchy, as is the case of many constitutional monarchies found in the world.
